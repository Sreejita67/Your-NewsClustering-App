Its exports, particularly in manufactured goods like cars and solar panels, are dominating global markets. Despite facing tariffs from various countries, including the U.S. and the EU, China's manufacturing output has grown substantially, making up about a third of the world's production. The country’s export boom has created millions of jobs, though domestic consumption has slowed due to economic challenges like a housing market crash and lost savings. Initiatives like Made in China 2025 have bolstered its self-reliance, and China is moving from importing to exporting products like cars and airplanes. While many countries have raised tariffs, China’s pricing remains competitive, making it the most cost-effective option for many importers worldwide"

This reflects the deep political polarization in the U.S., where landslide victories have become rare in recent elections. Both political parties increasingly use data to target voters and improve turnout, resulting in closer margins in presidential elections.

The hospital billed her insurer $22,700 for a drug with a list price of $2,700, resulting in a significant out-of-pocket cost for her. This situation stems from a federal program intended to help safety-net hospitals access affordable drugs, but it has expanded to include more hospitals, raising health care costs for patients, employers, and taxpayers.
