# Your-NewsClustering-App
This Flutter-based mobile app aims to automate the categorization of online news articles based on their content using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The core objective is to build a system that can fetch news articles, preprocess the text using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and generate semantic embeddings. These embeddings are then clustered using multiple unsupervised learning algorithms such as K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Agglomerative Clustering (AGNES), and Spectral Clustering.The system also incorporates Sentiment Analysis to gauge the emotional tone of each article and Trend Analysis to observe genre-wise news frequency over time. Users can select a country of interest, upon which the app fetches regional news, performs clustering, and displays results including:

1. Predicted genre/category 

2. Scores from different clustering algorithms
    
3. Sentiment Analysis of the article
   
4. Trend chart for current hot genres**

# How to Install and Run it?

# **1. Clone the Repository**

git clone <your-repo-url>

cd <your-project-folder>
________________________________________
**# 🧪 2. Set Up Python Backend (Flask + ML)**

# ✅ **a. Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate        # For Linux/macOS

venv\Scripts\activate           # For Windows

**# 📦 b. Install Required Python Packages**

pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure requirements.txt includes:

Flask

requests

nltk.download('omw-1.4')

**#▶️e. Run the Flask Server**

python app/main.py      
________________________________________
**# 📱3. Set Up Flutter App (Frontend)**

**# 🧰 a. Install Flutter SDK**

**# 📥 b. Navigate to the Flutter Project Folder**

cd  flutter_app_folder

**📦 # c. Install Dependencies**
flutter pub get

flutter run

Make sure a device/emulator is connected or running.
________________________________________
# **🔄 4. Connecting Flutter with Flask Backend**

•	Ensure your mobile app uses the correct API base URL (your Flask server's IP or domain).

•	For local testing:

o	Use 10.0.2.2 for Android Emulator.

o	Use your PC's local IP address for real devices.

Example:

final baseUrl = "http://10.0.2.2:5000";
